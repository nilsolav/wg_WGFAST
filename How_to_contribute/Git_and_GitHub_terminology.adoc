These are a few Git and GitHub terms you should be familiar with before starting.

* *_Git_* - A type of version control system (software).
* *_GitHub_* - An online (in the cloud) hosting service for Git repositories.
* *_Repository_* - Also called a "repo".  A repository is a permanent record of a project's development. It tracks all changes made to files in a project over time. Initializing a repository for a project creates a `.git` folder that stores the project's history. If you delete the `.git` folder, you delete the project's record of development.
* *_Clone_* (n.) / *_Cloning a repo_* (v.) - A clone of a repository is a complete (files and change histories) copy of a repository. You usually clone a repository from GitHub (hosting service) to your computer to work on project files locally.
* *_Fork_* (n.) / *_Forking a repo_* (v.) - This is a special term used by GitHub and a few other hosting services. It is not a Git command. A fork is a cloned repository owned by someone else that you manage in your GitHub account. You are going to fork the `ices-eg/wg_WGFAST` repository to your own GitHub account to work on files independently before submitting any changes back to the `ices-eg/wg_WGFAST` repository.
* *_Upstream repository_* - The repository you fork from.
* *_Remote repository_* - A repository on GitHub or another hosting service.
* *_Local repository_* - A repository on your computer.
* *_Branch_* - Branches of a repository are isolated development areas. You create a branch to work on part of a project without affecting the entire project. Every repository has one default branch, usually called `master`, and can have multiple other branches. You merge branches using a pull request.
* *_Checkout_* - "Checkout a branch" is to switch to a different branch in the repository.
* *_Staging area_* - The staging area stores changes and additions for the next commit. The first time you add a file to the staging area allows Git to start tracking changes to that file. Staging is the step before committing a file, or changes to a file, to a repository. You can continue to edit files that have been staged.
* *_Commit_* - Save all staged changes to your local repository.
* *_Push_* - Move changes (commits) from your local repository to a remote repository.
* *_Fetch_* - Retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging the changes into your local repository.
* *_Merge_* - Incorporate the commits and files from a source repository to a target repository into a unified history. You can also merge branches within a repository.
* *_Pull_* - Fetch and merge in one step.
* *_Pull Request_* - Also called a "PR". A pull request tells others about the changes you have made (all the commits) to the project. It is called a pull request because you are asking to pull the changes from a source to a target. You can create a pull request between branches of a single repository or between branches of different repositories. +

TIP: `ices-eg` (ICES Expert Groups) is the team that owns the workspace. `wg_WGFAST` is the repository for the FAST working group. +
