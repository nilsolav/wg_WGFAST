These are basic instructions on how to use the Git/GitHub GUI in Atom.


== Git/GitHub GUI in Atom
If this is the first time you are accessing GitHub through Atom, you will have to get an authentication token. Open the GitHub pane and follow the directions.

=== Clone
1. Open the GitHub pane by clicking on the GitHub tab. +
2. Click on "Clone an existing GitHub repository". +
3. Go to your forked repository in GitHub and copy the HTTPS address to the clipboard. See <<2_suggested_workflow.adoc#Clone the forked repository to your local computer,Clone the forked repository to your local computer>> in the Suggested Workflow file. +
4. In Atom, add the HTTPS address to "Clone from". +
Your user name will replace "erinann" in the GitHub address. +
5. Add the full pathname to the directory where you want to your local repository to live. Make sure that the name of the final folder is "wg_WGFAST". +
Note: There is no "Browse" option to add a full pathname. You have to type it in or copy and paste. +
6. Click on "Clone" +

=== Add upstream repository
As of today (2020-03-16) there is no GUI function to add the upstream remote repository (at least that I could find). You will have to do this in your terminal. +

=== New branch
1. Click on the branch icon. The default branch is `master`. +
2. Click on `New Branch` and type in the name of your new branch. +
*NAMING your branch* - You can name your branch anything you want, but please name it something descriptive. In the example below the branch is named with the author's initials and a SHORT description of the branch's purpose. +
3. Click on `Publish` to push your branch to your remote repository and set up tracking.

=== Edit files
Open a file and edit it. +

To open the AsciiDoc live preview pane, use `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Linux/Windows) or `cmd+shift+A` (macOS). The AsciiDoc packages have to be installed.

If you would like more room to view the live preview pane, you can close the Git and GitHub panels.

=== Stage and commit
1. To stage file(s), open the Git panel, right-click on the file(s) you want to stage and choose `Stage`. If you want to stage all the files, click on `Stage All`.
2. Enter a useful commit message to let people know what changes you made, and click `Commit to master`. +
Or, if you need to add a commit message more than 50 characters long, click on the square in the lower, right corner of the commit message text box to open the message editor. +

_Please follow best practices when writing commit messages_. +

=== Pushing to GitHub
1. Click on the `Push` to push your commits to your working branch of your remote repository. +

In this example, one commit will be pushed to the `EL_doc_edits` branch of the `erinann/wg_WGFAST` repository (remote) on GitHub. +
