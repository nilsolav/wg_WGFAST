These instructions are for people who have not used AsciiDoc markup before. +

All of the information in this help file comes directly from: +

.*Point of clarification*
*_Asciidoctor_* is the processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc files to HTML, PDF and other formats. *_AsciiDoc_* is the markup syntax.

== Why a lightweight markup?
AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language built around the idea that authors should spend their time writing, not messing around with finicky formatting issues. When you have to worry about inconsistent formatting that constantly creeps into what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editors like Microsoft Word or OpenDocs, writing becomes frustrating and more time consuming than it should be. Simply put, writing in plain text takes some of the frustration out of writing by creating consistent formats. One linespace will always be just one linespace. Also, plain text can easily be translated to different outputs (HTML, HTML5, PDF, etc.) for different applications. +

=== What is AsciiDoc?
[quote, https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/]
____
AsciiDoc is two things:

1. A mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.

2. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called backends), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub.

=== Installing Asciidoctor
Do not! +

Unless you work in Ruby, like diving into the guts of your operating system, and want to compile a backend on your computer, there is no need for you to install the Asciidoctor toolchain. The AsciidocFX, Atom, and Brackets text editors/IDEs work well for editing and previewing the convention documents.


[TIP]
====
If you use Windows 10 and you want to install the Asciidoctor toolchain, initiate the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem for Linux] (WSL) and install Ruby, Ruby Version Manager, and the Asciidoctor toolchain there.

The link:experienced_github_users.adoc[A quick workflow for experienced Git and GitHub users] document will get you started.

== AsciiDoc basics
If you have not used AsciiDoc markup before, it's a good idea to open thep https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writer's Guide'] and read through it with one of the  `.adoc` files open in your text editor/IDE. Honestly, the AsciiDoc Writer's guide is well done.

Some of the formatting used in the WGFAST conventions:

* Attributes (globally set in the document header, but can be modified inline)
* Section titles (heading, including the document title)
* Lists
* Breaks
* Formatted text
* Tables
* Included files


TIP: You can find a list of AsciiDoc Attributes and their descriptsions in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attribute-catalog[_Appendix A: Catalog of Documents Attributes_] of the Asciidoctor User Manual.


Below we will show some of the basics of the *document header* with its attributes, *section titles*, *formatted text*, *breaks*, and *lists*. Please refer to the online documentation for detailed explanations of other AsciiDoc markup.

=== Document header
The document's title, authors, and attributes are set in the header.

== AsciiDoc vs. Markdown
Markdown is probably more familiar to many people, especially if you work in R and use RMarkdown. So, why are we using AsciiDoc instead of Markdown? Many or the formatting options in Markdown are the same or similar in AsciiDoc, but AsciiDoc syntax is more concise and it is more flexible when creating table of contents, lists, tables, and admonitions (tip, notes, warnings, etc.).

=== Comparison by example
The table comparing AsciiDoc and Markdown syntax in this section was recreated from the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#comparison-by-example[1.5.3 Comparison by example] section of the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor User Manual].

The following table shows the AsciiDoc syntax as it compares to Markdown.
Since AsciiDoc supports a broader range of syntax than Markdown, this side-by-side comparison focuses mainly on areas where the syntax overlaps.

{asterisk} Asciidoctor also supports the Markdown syntax for this language feature.

You can see that AsciiDoc has the following advantages over Markdown:

* AsciiDoc uses the same number of markup characters or less when compared to Markdown in nearly all cases.
* AsciiDoc uses a consistent formatting scheme (i.e., it has consistent patterns).
* AsciiDoc can handle all permutations of nested inline (and block) formatting, whereas Markdown often falls down.
* AsciiDoc handles cases that Markdown doesn't, such as a proper approach to inner-word markup, source code blocks and block-level images.
